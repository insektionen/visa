//: What shall we do with the drunken sailor? :// (x3)
Early in the morning!

//: Put him in the longboat til' he's sober ... :// (x3)
Early in the morning!

//: Way-hay, and up she rises! :// (x3)
Early in the morning!

Put him in the scupper with a hosepipe on him...
Pull out the plug and wet him all over...
Put him in bed with the captain's daughter...
Shave his belly with a rusty razor...
Hang him from the mast like a Jolly Roger...
Throw him in the bilge and make him drink it...
Stick him in a bag and beat him senseless...
Put him in the hull with an angry weasel...
Hang him from the yardarm til' he dangles...
