I've been a wild rover for many's the year,
I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer.
But now I'm returning with gold in great store,
and I never will play the wild rover no more.

And it's no, nay, never!
No, nay, never, no more,
will I play the wild rover.
No never no more!

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent,
and I told the landlady me money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me "nay,
such a custom as yours I could have any day".

And it's no, nay, never ...

I took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright,
and the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.
She said "I have whiskeys and wines of the best,
and the words I just spoke they were only in jest".

And it's no, nay, never ...

I'll have none of your whiskeys,
nor fine Spanish wines,
for your words show you clearly as no friend of mine.
There's others most willing to open a door,
to a man coming home from a far distant shore.

And it's no, nay, never ...

I'll go home to me parents, confess what I've done,
and I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
And when they've caressed me as oft times before,
I never will play the wild rover no more.

And it's no, nay, never ...
