title: Under the Scotsman's Kilt

Well, a Scotsman clad in kilt
left the bar one evening fair,
and one could tell by how he walked
that he'd drunk more than his share.

He fumbled round until he
could no longer keep his feet,
then stumbled off into the grass
to sleep beside the street.

Ring ding diddle diddle i de o,
ring di diddle i o.
He stumbled off into the grass to
sleep beside the street.

About that time two young and
lovely girls just happened by,
and one says to the other
with a twinkle in her eye:

"See yon sleeping Scotsman
so strong and handsome built,
I wonder if it's true what they
don't wear beneath the kilt?"

Ring ding diddle diddle i de o,
ring di diddle i o.
"I wonder if it's true what
they don't wear beneath the kilt?"

They crept up on that sleeping
Scotsman quiet as could be,
lifted up his kilt about
an inch so they could see.

And there behold for them to view
beneath his Scottish skirt,
was nothing more than God had
graced him with upon his birth.

Ring ding diddle diddle i de o,
ring di diddle i o.
Was nothing more than God had
graced him with upon his birth.

They marveled for a moment,
then one said: "We must be gone,
let's leave a present for our friend
before we move along."

As a gift they left a blue silk
ribbon tied into a bow,
around the bonnie spar that
the Scot's kilt did lift and show.

Ring ding diddle diddle i de o,
ring di diddle i o.
Around the bonnie spar that
the Scot's kilt did lift and show.

Now the Scotsman woke to nature's
call and stumbled toward a tree,
behind a bush he lifts his kilt and
gawks at what he sees.

And in a startled voice he says
to what's before his eyes,
Aw, "Lad I don't know where you've
been but I see you won first prize!"

Ring ding diddle diddle i de o,
ring di diddle i o.
Aw, "Lad I don't know where you've
been but I see you won first prize!"
