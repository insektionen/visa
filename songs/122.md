Yesterday,
all those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There's not half the files there used to be,
and there's a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.

I pushed something wrong,
what it was I could not say.
All my data's gone,
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
now I believe in yesterday.
