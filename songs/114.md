As I went home on Monday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw a horse outside the door
where my old horse should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns that horse outside the door
where my old horse should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk, you silly old fool.
Still you can not see, that's a lovely sow
that me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled
a hundred miles or more,
but a saddle on a sow, sure I never saw before.

And as I went home on Tuesday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw a coat behind the door
where my old coat should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns that coat behind the door
where my old coat should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool.
Still you can not see, that's a woollen blanket
that me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled
a hundred miles or more,
but buttons in a blanket, sure I never saw before.

And as I went home on Wednesday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw a pipe up on the chair
where my old pipe should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns that pipe up on the chair
where my old pipe should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk, you silly old fool.
Still you can not see that's a lovely tin whistle
that me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled
a hundred miles or more,
but tobacco in a tin whistle
sure I never saw before.

And as I went home on Thursday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw two boots beneath the bed
where my old boots should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns them boots beneath the bed
where my old boots should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk, you silly old fool.
Still you can not see, they're two lovely
Geranium pots me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled
a hundred miles or more,
but laces in Geranium pots I never saw before.

And as I went home on Friday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw a head upon the bed
where my old head should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns that head upon the bed
where my old head should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool.
Still you can not see, that's a baby boy
that me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled
a hundred miles or more,
but a baby boy with his whiskers on
sure I never saw before.

And as I went home on Saturday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw two hands upon her breasts
where my old hands should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns them hands upon your breasts
where my old hands should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool.
Still you can not see, that's a lovely night gown
that me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled
a hundred miles or more,
but fingers in a night gown sure I never saw before.

As I went home on Sunday night
as drunk as drunk could be,
I saw a thing in her thing
where my old thing should be.

Well, I called me wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
who owns that thing in your thing,
where my old thing should be?

Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool.
Still you can not see, that's a lovely hammer
that me mother sent to me.

Well, it's many a day I've travelled,
a hundred miles or more,
but a hammer with a head like that
sure I never saw before.
